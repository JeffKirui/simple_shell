## Project Title: Simple Shell Implementation

### Description:

A Simple Shell Implementation is a software project that aims to create a basic Unix-like shell program, which provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. The project involves building a minimalistic shell that allows users to execute commands, navigate the filesystem, and manage processes.

### Key Features:

##Command Execution:
The simple shell allows users to execute various system commands, such as running programs, listing files, and performing basic operations like copying and moving files.

##Shell Prompt:
It provides a user-friendly shell prompt where users can enter commands. The prompt typically displays the current working directory, username, and hostname.

##Built-in Commands:
The shell includes support for built-in commands like cd (change directory) and exit (terminate the shell), which are executed by the shell itself rather than spawning external processes.

##Redirection and Piping:
The shell supports input and output redirection, allowing users to read from and write to files. Additionally, users can create pipelines to pass the output of one command as input to another.
